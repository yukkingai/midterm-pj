            <h3 class="hidden">What I like about Australia?</h3>
            <p>I like Australia for many reasons. It is because the weather is nice, and it is similar to Hawaii where I most love with. 
                I also very bias on most Aussie are friendly and have a strong sense of humor. They are pretty laid-back which I'm interested in this lifestyle.
                Why I think that? I have a few Aussie friends, and we worked together for a couple of years that let me understand how lovely they are.
                Therefore, I love the people there at the first place even though I never been to there. Moreover, the landscapes in Australia are stunning, and I would like to visit some nice places there for an amazing photograph.

                I would prefer Australia because of the warm weather and cool places everywhere. 
                I like the landscapes, such as beaches, green mountain in four seasons, 
                historial buildings and arts galleries in downtown Melbourne. Famous landmarks in Sydney, 
                red wine farms in Adelaide, and aurora light in Tasmania, etc.
                However, the most important reason is that Australia is nearby Hong Kong where I come from, 
                so that I can visit my homwtown easier within a short distance of flight.
                BUT Canada is way far from Hong Kong, nor I won't be able to enjoy sun-light and beaches most of the time. 
                One more down-side is that the winter is so long for me, and will I gonna like it? I'm not sure.
