            <h3 class="hidden">What I like about Canada?</h3>
            <p>I have been staying in Canada for the second month now, 
                it is not that bad as I always have heater around me during the winter time which is the most concern if you ask me.
                Also, I'm enjoying the snow fall most of the time, and it's nice to have this view outside of my window when I eat my breakfast.
                I feel so satisfied with this and will be so happy all day long.
                Furthermore, I realize I was into ice skating in my childhood, and Canada always have a natual lake for that or man-make skating place in the mall.
                I could also try some winter sports activities which I never have this opportunity in a warmer country before.

                So, Canada is better than Australia? The winter is the best while I'm stay in the house with my fireplace. IT IS COLD OUTSIDE.
                I heard that Australia is more discriminate Chinese people, and Canada is one of the most country with different ethnicities in the world.
                People in Canada are most likely from all over the world than in Australia, hence, this make it better.
                The last reason is I could be speak my hometown language in Markham or Richmond Hill or Scarborugh Canada without any trouble of daily life! 
                This is so special compare to Australia.
